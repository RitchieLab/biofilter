### 🔄 What is "Update DB"?

The **Update DB** section of Biofilter3R refers to all operations involved in keeping the database current, complete, and synchronized with the latest external biological resources. These updates are structured, traceable, and follow a well-defined process to ensure data quality and reproducibility.

This section acts as the entry point to:

- Execute ETL pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Track what has been loaded and when
- Identify available data sources
- Apply schema migrations if necessary

---

### 🧱 Core Concepts

- **ETL**: Pipelines for ingesting data from external sources
- **DTPs**: Modular components that implement the ETL logic for each source
- **ETL Logs**: Track and record each data ingestion activity
- **Biofilter Seeds**: Bootstrap data to define core structures
- **Schema Migrations**: Evolve the structure of the database when needed

---

In short, "Update DB" is your go-to section when new data becomes available or when setting up a new Biofilter3R instance.

Stay updated — stay accurate!
