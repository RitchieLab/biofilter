## 🧬 What Is the Gene Ontology in Biofilter3R?

## 🧬 What Is the Gene Ontology in Biofilter3R?

The **Gene Ontology (GO)** provides a structured vocabulary to describe **molecular functions**, **biological processes**, and **cellular components** of genes and gene products.

In Biofilter3R, GO terms are represented using a combination of **dedicated models** and the **shared entity infrastructure**, allowing:

- Rich navigation through the GO DAG (directed acyclic graph)
- Entity-level integration (genes, proteins, etc.)
- Flexible storage of relationships, annotations, and namespaces

---

## 📚 GO Schema Overview

| Model | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GOMaster` | Stores individual GO terms as records, each linked to a unique `Entity` |
| `GORelation` | Defines parent–child relationships between GO terms (`is_a`, `part_of`) |

---

## 🔹 `GOMaster`

Each GO term is stored in `GOMaster`, linked to a core `Entity`. This allows the term to:

- Have aliases (`EntityName`)
- Be involved in relationships (`EntityRelation`)
- Participate in queries across domains

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `go_id` | GO identifier (e.g., `GO:0003700`) |
| `entity_id` | FK to the main `Entity` table |
| `name` | Term label (e.g., “DNA-binding transcription factor activity”) |
| `namespace` | GO category: `MF` (Molecular Function), `BP` (Biological Process), `CC` (Cellular Component) |

> 🧠 GO terms are stored as standard entities, allowing integration with any other omics object in the system.

## 🔁 `GORelation`

This table captures the **graph structure** of the Gene Ontology, where terms can be related hierarchically:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `parent_id` | ID of the parent term (`GOMaster.id`) |
| `child_id` | ID of the child term (`GOMaster.id`) |
| `relation_type` | Relationship type (`is_a`, `part_of`, etc.) |

The system supports **multiple relation types**, representing the DAG structure of the ontology. Examples:

| Relation Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `is_a` | The child is a more specific subtype of the parent |
| `part_of` | The child is a component or step within the parent |

> 🔬 You can navigate GO hierarchies using these relationships (e.g., find all descendants of a term).

## 🔄 Linking GO to Genes and Proteins

While older systems often used a dedicated `GeneGoAnnotation` table, Biofilter3R integrates all cross-domain relationships (including gene–GO links) via the central **`EntityRelation`** table.

This approach allows:

- Storing **gene–GO**, **protein–GO**, or **pathway–GO** relationships in a unified way
- Extending metadata via optional fields (e.g., evidence codes)
- Querying from either side (e.g., all GO terms of a gene, or all genes of a GO term)

> 🧠 Evidence codes (e.g., EXP, IEA) and sources can be extended in the future via auxiliary tables or embedded fields in EntityRelation.

## 💡 Design Highlights

- **Entity-based modeling**: Each GO term is treated as an `Entity`, ensuring standardization and relationship compatibility
- **Fully navigable DAG**: The `GORelation` table enables upward and downward traversal in the ontology graph
- **Namespace-aware**: Each term is tagged as Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP), or Cellular Component (CC)
- **Future-ready**: Easily extendable to include additional metadata, evidence, and external cross-references

## 🧠 Summary

- Gene Ontology terms are stored in `GOMaster` and linked to entities
- Hierarchical relationships are stored in `GORelation`
- GO term usage is integrated into Biofilter3R via `EntityRelation`
- The design supports namespace tracking, graph traversal, and cross-domain linking
