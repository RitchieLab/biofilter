# Black Code Formatter Guide

Black is a code formatter for Python that automatically reformats your code to be more readable and standardized.
This guide provides essential information for using Black within this project.

## Installation

To install Black, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install black
```

## Basic Usage

To format all Python files in your project, run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
black .
```

This command applies Black's formatting rules to all `.py` files in the directory and its subdirectories.

### Formatting a Specific File

If you want to format a specific file, specify the filename:

```bash
black path/to/your_file.py
```

## Common Options

- **Check Mode**: To check if files would be reformatted without making changes, use:

    ```bash
    black --check .
    ```

- **Line Length**: By default, Black limits lines to 88 characters. You can set a different line length:

    ```bash
    black --line-length 100 .
    ```

- **Exclude Files**: To exclude specific files or directories from formatting, use:

    ```bash
    black --exclude "migrations|env" .
    ```

## Integrating Black with Pre-Commit Hooks

To ensure consistent formatting before commits, you can set up a pre-commit hook.

1. First, install `pre-commit` if it's not already installed:

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2. Then, create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the root directory with this content:

    ```yaml
    repos:
      - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
        rev: 23.1.0  # Use the latest Black version
        hooks:
          - id: black
    ```

3. Install the hook:

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

With this setup, Black will automatically format your code before each commit.

## Tips for Working with Black

- **Consistency**: Black enforces a uniform style, helping keep code consistent across the project.
- **Automation**: Use Black in your CI/CD pipeline to automate code style checks.
- **Editor Integration**: Black is supported by most IDEs and editors, including VS Code and PyCharm.
