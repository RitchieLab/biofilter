I have been analyzing this case using the LiftOver functionality in Biofilter and LOKI.

The latest version of the LOKI database is built on GRCh38, while I understand that you intend to provide positions from a different assembly (e.g., GRCh37).

To address this, I created a test scenario where a different assembly is provided as input than the one the LOKI data file was built on. I observed that Biofilter compares the assembly version of the LOKI file with the one specified in the arguments (--ucsc-build-version, e.g., "19"). If a mismatch is detected, a conversion table (e.g., from GRCh37 to GRCh38) is used to convert the input positions, and all queries are processed using the converted coordinates.

The output will retain the original positions as labels (e.g., GRCh37/hg19), while the results will be aligned with the GRCh38 coordinates.

I have documented this process in more detail here: [link to documentation].

Does this approach address your requirements? If not, Iâ€™d be happy to discuss alternative solutions.
